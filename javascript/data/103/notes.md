# JavaScript Data 103
## The data types for `null` and `undefined` are slightly different than other data types 


### `null`
```
let captainName = null;
console.log(captainName) --> null
//null is the absence of data
```

### `undefined`
```
let manager;
console.log(manager) --> undefined
//undefined is the computer not knowing 
```
